This project uses Python, Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and the Google Gemini API to create an intelligent tool for exploring and analyzing datasets effortlessly.
🔥 Key Features:
✅ Upload, edit, and manage datasets (CRUD operations)
 ✅ Interactive data visualization — histograms, bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, pie charts
 ✅ AI-generated dataset reports using Gemini — get insights, summaries, and trends automatically
 ✅ Natural Language to Python Code: Ask questions like "What is the average sales?" and the AI converts it to executable code
 ✅ Download modified datasets and AI-generated reports easily
💡 Tech Stack:
Python
Streamlit (for interactive web app)
Pandas & NumPy (data manipulation)
Matplotlib (data visualization)
